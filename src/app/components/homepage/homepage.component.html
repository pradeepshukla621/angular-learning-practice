<b> What Is Angular? </b>
<p>
    Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework developed by Google for building dynamic, scalable, and
    maintainable
    single-page applications (SPAs). It emphasizes modular architecture, component-based development, and powerful
    tooling
    to streamline web app creation.
</p>

<b> Key Features of Angular: (Short) </b>
<ul>
<li>   Component-Based Architecture: Encapsulates UI logic into reusable components. </li>
<li>    Two-Way Data Binding: Syncs data between model and view seamlessly. </li>
<li>    Dependency Injection: Promotes modularity and testability. </li>
<li>    Routing: Enables navigation between views without full page reloads. </li>
<li>    RxJS Integration: Handles asynchronous data streams efficiently. </li>
<li>    TypeScript Support: Offers strong typing and modern JavaScript features. </li>
</ul>


<b> Key Features of Angular: </b>
<ul>
    <li>Component-Based Architecture: Angular applications are built using components, which encapsulate the UI and
        logic for a specific part of the application. This promotes reusability and maintainability.</li>
    <li>TypeScript: Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and advanced
        features, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.</li>
    <li>Two-Way Data Binding: Angular provides two-way data binding, allowing automatic synchronization between the model
        (data) and the view (UI). Changes in the model are reflected in the view and vice versa.</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage and
        inject services and dependencies into components, promoting modularity and testability.</li>
    <li>Directives: Angular uses directives to extend HTML capabilities. Structural directives (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor)
        modify the DOM structure, while attribute directives (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle) change the appearance or behavior of
        elements.</li>
    <li>Routing: Angular includes a powerful router that enables navigation between different views or pages within a
        single-page application, supporting lazy loading and nested routes.</li>
    <li>Forms: Angular provides robust support for building forms, including template-driven and reactive forms,
        facilitating validation and user input handling.</li>
    <li>RxJS Integration: Angular leverages RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) for handling asynchronous operations,
        making it easier to work with streams of data and events.</li>
    <li>CLI Tooling: The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that simplifies project setup, development,
        testing, and deployment tasks.</li>
    <li>Cross-Platform Development: Angular supports building applications for web, mobile (using frameworks like Ionic),
        and desktop (using Electron).</li>
 </ul>
